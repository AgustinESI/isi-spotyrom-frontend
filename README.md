# SpotyROM-Frontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.10.
Project developed for the implementation of a digital application that integrates up to 5 web services. The implementation is MVP, which involves creating an initial version of a product with a minimal set of features that is sufficient to attract early users and validate the concept's viability. Additionally, the system has been developed using agile SCRUM methodologies, planned in 4 sprints:

    - Sprint 1 (February 27)
    - Sprint 2 (March 5)
    - Sprint 3 (April 2)
    - Sprint 4 (April 16)
